Here we are doing again the warriors workshop of Codeable.

## Intro

This is a game where the player choose a character to fight a dragon.

## Characters

The player can choose between 2 characters with diferent stats and attacks(moves).

1. Warrior
2. Magician

Each character will have these stats:

- Hp
- Speed

Also the character will have different attacks depending on its type.

There are four types of dragons (lockheed, drogon, godzilla and smaug) with which you can fight, which you can touch randomly one of them.

## Attacks

Depending on the attack different amount of damage will be inflicted to the other character.

Also there is a chance that the attack will miss its oponent, this depend on the attack chosen.

## Battle

In battle both characters will fight.
A character will be chosen to attack first, this depends on the attack priority and if they are equal a random character will be chosen first.

After an attack the character will affects its hits points (Hp) with the damage of the attack.

The battle continues until one of the caracters faints.
